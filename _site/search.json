In addition to fighting existential crisis, I also spend time learning about public policy, data science & development. I am currently focusing on public policy and how I can contribute to it using my learnings from United Nations University ( UNU-MERIT) and R. In my previous life I was a civil (the profession, not the personality) engineer. I have also worked as a tutor, a researcher and as a content developer in the edtech industry. In my personal life I like to explore music, movies, anime, history, science etc. I speak Malayalam, English, Tamizh, Hindi, and (sometimes) sarcasm."
