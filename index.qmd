I am Nikhil Pakkattil Muraleedharan and this is my personal website. I
am using it to share my thoughts, experiences, and journeys. In addition
to fighting existential crisis, I also spend time learning about public
policy, data science & development. I am currently focusing on
public policy and how I can contribute to it using my learnings from
United Nations University (
[UNU-MERIT](https://www.merit.unu.edu/))
and R. In my previous life I was a civil (the profession, not the
personality) engineer. I have also worked as a tutor, a researcher and
as a content developer in the edtech industry. In my personal life I
like to explore music, movies, anime, history, science etc. I speak
Malayalam, English, Tamizh, Hindi, and (sometimes) sarcasm.
